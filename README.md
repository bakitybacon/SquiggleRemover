===============

A comparison of IO in three languages (Perl, Java, and Haskell).

Basically, these programs all start in a directory and remove all files ending with '~' (gedit and vim backup files) and all subdirectories.

Perl is impossible to understand but the most concise and fastest.

Java is, surprisingly, the easiest to understand, but the slowest by far and most wordy.

Haskell is rather quick, but the Monads and funky operators are a little unclear. It's fairly short.
